# Common Machine Learning Techniques

Code and data files to practice and cover basic concepts of common machine learning techniques: 

* CART & Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine

### Reports and Documentations
The report with detailed explanations go along with code is: [`Big_Data_report.pdf`](https://github.com/maianhdang/basic_machine_learning/blob/master/Big_Data_report.pdf)

### Dataset
The original data comes from a real dataset of *Caisse d'Epargne*, which could be found in `data` folder, with the code files of `lecture_visprem.R`, `transf_visprem.R`, and `code_visprem.R` to clean the data. 
The order of running these three programs is documented in the report.
